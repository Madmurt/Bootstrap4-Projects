# Bootstrap4-Projects
Several projects utilizing bootstrap 4.

Following Brad Traversy's Bootstrap 4 from scratch Udemy course.

I setup the starter pack which I also created from this course. This gives a real development workflow to compile Bootstrap 4 from source and compile Sass. It will even give us a dev server with autoload using gulp and browserSync.



Using the starter pack the projects are,

LoopLap - A social UI Theme

Mizuxe - A Book/Product Showcase Theme

Blogen - A blog admin area UI

Glozzom - A multi page theme with a carousel and some 3rd party scripts

Portfoligrid - A portfolio theme using the grid, flexbox and the collapse widget
